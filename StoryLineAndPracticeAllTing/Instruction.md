**Comprehensive Tableau Storyline Creation with Netflix and HR Data**

**Objective:** Integrate all the skills and techniques you have learned in Tableau from the start of this course to create an engaging and informative storyline using Netflix and HR datasets. You will need to apply table calculations, advanced dashboard techniques, and storytelling to present a narrative that provides insights into the provided datasets.

**Instructions:**

1. **Comprehensive Review:**
   - Revisit the materials from the beginning of the course through to Section 6. Ensure you have a solid understanding of all the functionalities and techniques, including mapping, table calculations, creating bins and distributions, using parameters, and crafting dashboards.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Datasets Provided:** Two datasets will be used for this assignment: Netflix and HR. Start by connecting to these datasets in Tableau and familiarize yourself with the content, identifying key metrics and potential stories within the data.

3. **Visualization Development:**
   - Develop a series of visualizations that utilize the skills you have learned:
     - **Table Calculations:** Perform calculations that could segment data by gender or other demographics within the HR dataset.
     - **Geographical Mapping:** Set geographical roles for data points in the Netflix dataset and create maps that display streaming patterns or popularity.
     - **Bins and Distributions:** Create bins and distributions to analyze age-related data or tenure within the HR dataset.
     - **Parameters and Tree Maps:** Use parameters to control aspects of your visualization and create tree maps to display hierarchical data or customer segmentation from the Netflix dataset.
     - **Advanced Dashboard:** Assemble your visualizations into an advanced, interactive dashboard. Utilize techniques such as dashboard actions for a seamless and dynamic user experience.

4. **Storyline Creation:**
   - Craft a compelling storyline in Tableau that ties together your visualizations into a narrative. This storyline should:
     - Highlight key insights and trends from both datasets.
     - Use dashboard interactivity to guide the viewer through the data story.
     - Present a clear and logical flow of information, leading to a well-supported conclusion.
