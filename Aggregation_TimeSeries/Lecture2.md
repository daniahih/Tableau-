**Assignment: Practice with Time Series and Aggregation in Tableau**

**Objective:** Today, we will apply the concepts of time series analysis and data aggregation using Tableau, as covered in Section 3 of our course on Udemy. By utilizing the provided Superstore dataset, you will demonstrate your understanding of these concepts through practical application, resulting in a meaningful visualization that adheres to the topics discussed in this section.

**Instructions:**

1. **Review of Learning Materials:**
   - Before beginning the exercise, ensure that you have completed all the lectures in Section 3: Time Series, Aggregation, and Filters on Udemy. Pay particular attention to lectures on working with time series and understanding aggregation.

2. **Dataset Exploration:**
   - **Dataset Provided:** The Superstore dataset will be used for this exercise. Familiarize yourself with the data, focusing on the date fields and the possibilities for aggregation.

3. **Creating Visualizations:**
   - Using Tableau, you are tasked to create visualizations that incorporate the following elements:
     - **Time Series Analysis:** Create a time series chart to analyze sales trends over time. Consider how different time granularities (such as monthly or quarterly) reveal different patterns.
     - **Aggregation:** Utilize aggregation functions to display summarized data, such as total sales or average profit.
     - **Filters:** Apply filters to your visualizations to focus on specific time periods, categories, or other relevant segments of the data.

4. **Documentation and Insight:**
   - Alongside your visualizations, provide a brief explanation of:
     - The reasoning behind your choice of time granularity and aggregation.
     - The insights or patterns revealed by your analysis.
     - How the applied filters contribute to the analysis.

5. **Submission:**
   - Compile your Tableau workbook, including all the visualizations, and a separate document for your explanations.
   - Submit your completed work through the course's learning management system (LMS) by the deadline indicated.
