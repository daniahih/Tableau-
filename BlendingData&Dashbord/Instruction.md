**Assignment: H&M Sales Data Analysis with Advanced Tableau Techniques**

**Objective:** Leverage the advanced features of Tableau covered in Section 5 to analyze the provided H&M sales data. You will be applying data blending, creating dual-axis charts, and formulating calculated fields to gain deeper insights into the sales performance.

**Instructions:**

1. **Review Section 5 Content:**
   - Before starting the assignment, ensure that you have thoroughly reviewed the lectures in Section 5, including Data Blending, Dual Axis Chart creation, and the creation of Calculated Fields in a blend. These concepts are fundamental for the completion of your task.

2. **Dataset Exploration:**
   - **Dataset Provided:** You will be working with the H&M sales dataset. Begin by examining the data, identifying potential areas for blending, and understanding the sales metrics.

3. **Visualization and Analysis Tasks:**
   - **Data Blending:** Use Tableau's data blending feature to combine the H&M sales data with any other relevant data source you have been provided with or have access to.
   - **Dual Axis Chart:** Create a dual-axis chart to compare two different measures, such as monthly sales and the average transaction value, to provide a multifaceted view of the data.
   - **Calculated Fields:** Implement calculated fields to create new insights from the blended data. This could involve calculating year-over-year growth, sales performance indexes, or other metrics that require calculations across your blended datasets.
