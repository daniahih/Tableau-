**Assignment: Visualizing Call Center Data with Maps, Scatterplots, and Dashboards in Tableau**

**Objective:** Building on the knowledge acquired in Section 4 of our Udemy course, you will utilize the call center dataset to create visualizations that explore geographical trends, relationships between data points, and compile them into an interactive dashboard in Tableau.

**Instructions:**

1. **Review Section 4 Content:**
   - Make sure you have completed all the lectures in Section 4, which includes understanding and applying relationships and joins, creating maps and scatterplots, and designing interactive dashboards.

2. **Dataset Familiarization:**
   - **Dataset Provided:** You will use the call center dataset for this assignment. Begin by exploring the dataset to understand the geographical and operational data available to you.

3. **Visualization Tasks:**
   - **Creating a Map:** Using the location data in the call center dataset, create a geographical map that shows the distribution of calls or any other relevant metric.
   - **Creating a Scatterplot:** Develop a scatterplot to analyze the relationship between two quantitative metrics from the dataset, like call duration and customer satisfaction.
   - **Creating a Dashboard:** Combine your map and scatterplot along with any other relevant data views into a cohesive dashboard.
   - **Interactive Actions:** Enhance your dashboard with interactive actions such as filters and highlighting to allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
